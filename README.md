# ShareMyRide

[![Made with Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Flutter-%2345D1FE)](https://flutter.dev/)

 ### Almost every day, every hour, thousands of vehicles crosses hundreds of miles from various locations  without realizing the fact that many of them follow the same route at the same time.

### Wouldn’t be great, if there was an App such that when students have 1-2 seats vacant they could use it for real-time ride-sharing and earn some money…

## Less traffic, Less Pollution, Save expenses !

This app is ideal for students looking for a ride to and from college, saving them money as well as the hassles of commuting using public transport
